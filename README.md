This repository acts as a digital instance of my working memory. Specifically the part of it that's concerned with web development, hence the name _this_ (for the pleasure of my fellow JS developers).

## Overview

At a high level, the following types of items are stored in this repository for self-study and future reference:

- Code snippets.
- Fully functional or partially functional practice projects.
- Educational content in the form of PDF guides, charts, or diagrams.

All of the above types of items are developed through one of the following processes:

- By coding independently to fulfill an assignment of a given educational resource.
- By coding independently to experiment with a concept/technology.
- By coding along a course/tutorial/lesson video.
- By coding along a book/article/blog post.

## Purpose

> “It does not matter where you go and what you study, what matters most is what you share with yourself and the world.” ― Santosh Kalwar

The main purpose of this repository is to act as a reference _to me_ if I ever find myself needing to remember a concept, a term, or how an app feature was implemented in a specific use case. I do not claim ownership of any code or content you'll find here except items in _this.study_ and _this.template_ folders. The only reason I made this repository public is to expose to the outside world the materials that I use for self-studying. I'm aware that most people choose to keep their grinding process hidden from the rest of the community. The existence of this repository is just my way of doing the opposite.

## Structure

There are five folders under this repository:

- assets
- this.buffer
- this.study
- this.template
- this.workshop

The _assets_ folder acts as a catch-all folder for any file/folder that's not a project, like the tree image shown in this README.md file.

All the remaining four folders are designed to store files that are at different stages of learning and/or files for different purposes. This categorization makes it easy for me to pinpoint a resource/concept/code snippet that I need to remember in the least amount of time possible.

Below you can see a table that summarizes the purpose of each subfolder in this repository:

| Folder        | Contains                                                                                              |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| this.buffer   | Practice projects or code-along projects that I'm currently working on.                               |
| this.study    | Practice projects or code-along projects that I've worked on in the past.                             |
| this.template | Boilerplate code (like a CSS reset file) that I've been accumulating over time.                       |
| this.workshop | Projects that I independently wrote, from scratch, as part of an assignment or a personal experiment. |

### this.buffer

There is no predefined structure under this folder because it contains code that I'm actively working on. I sometimes forego the luxury of tidiness in place of speed when I'm working on something new.

### this.study

Some online courses advise students to present their final projects (which are built in guidance of an instructor) in their portfolio as _independently built_ projects in order to land jobs. In contrast, I think presenting bootcamp projects as part of our portfolio is misleading on two levels: (1) On displaying our skillset to others, (2) on self-assessing how much we've progressed at a skill. All of this is personal opinion, which is another reason why I chose to spare only one place in my GitHub account to hold projects that I wrote **following the guidance of someone else**. That folder is _this.study_.

Projects in this folder are split under two subfolders: _watchable_ and _readable_. The projects under _watchable_ are projects that I built as part of a course, tutorial, or lesson that I watched. The projects under _readable_ are projects that I build as part of a book, article, or blog post that I've read.

Each project's folder name is derived from the following template:

> <CONTENT_NAME> by <CONTENT_CREATOR>

where _<CONTENT_NAME>_ is the name of a book/course/tutorial and _<CONTENT_CREATOR>_ is the name of the author/teacher.

### this.template

This folder contains boilerplate code snippets, configuration files, or folder hierarchies for new projects. Files in this folder are separated under different subfolders with each of them being named after their related technology. Note that configuration files and folder structures found here are highly opinionated. Thus, they reflect _a way_ of doing things rather than _the way_ of doing things.

### this.workshop

Projects in this folder sit at the top level. Each folder in here contains a fully (or partially) functional project.

## Contribution

Being a source of reference doesn't make this repository closed to contribution. If you find yourself banging your head against the wall due to how a feature was implemented in a project, I would highly appreciate it if you let me know.

Lastly, if you dig _really_ hard enough, you may or may not come accross with several API keys that were used for various experiments and purposes. You don't need to bother sending me a warning email though :) All of the API keys are revoked before they make it to GitHub.
